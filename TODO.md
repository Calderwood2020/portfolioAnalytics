## Todo List

### Additional functions

* Complete the universe of Gaussian models
** Some interesting special cases (large pool + single exposure)
** Some tractable inhomogeneous problems
** More analytic moments (skew, curtosis)
* Expands to non-Gaussian distributions

### Robust implementation

The functions should ultimately be coded to a high standard of robustness:
* input validation
* exception handling
* controlled accuracy 

Idea would be to follow best practise from some of the more mainstream python mathematical libraries
