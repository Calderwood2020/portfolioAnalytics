## Todo List

### Provide additional functions

* Complete the universe of analytic solutions for Gaussian models
  * Include some interesting special cases (e.g., large pool + single exposure)
  * Include some tractable inhomogeneous problems
* Calculate more statistical moments (e.g., skew, kurtosis)
* Expand to non-Gaussian distributions

### Make a more robust implementation

Introduce testing framework

The functions should ultimately be coded to a high standard of robustness:
* input validation
* exception handling
* controlled accuracy
